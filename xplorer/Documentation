Package: xplorer (pronounced explore R)

This documentation addresses some of the limitations of xplorer for each function (barplotr, pieplotr, and tabler).

Barplotr ()

1. When 'y_variable <- dplyr::enquo(y_variable)' is present, the ifelse statement called '#2. barplor - Plot Count' is not evaluated.
The following error is given: Error: stat_boxplot requires the following missing aesthetics: y

I tried the following failed solution:

if (!is.null(y_variable)){
y_variable <- dplyr::enquo(y_variable)
}

Note: not putting y_variable in quosures assures that all functions are evaluated. The tradeoff is that the y-axis name will not be what the user writes, but will be 'y' instead.

2. The barplot for the mean of Y with standard error bars does not sort in ascending or descending order.

I tried the following failed solution:

reorder() was used within ggplot and then on the dataframe.


3. Interactive plots are all saved. It would be nice if users could specify when and where to save plots.

4. Defense coding still needs implementation so users have meaningful error messages.


Pieplotr ()

1. Colors could be coordinated better so nested pieplots are visually pleasant.

2. A cleaning step is required for some of the datasets. This cleaning should be implemented within the function.

For example, I used the following lines to either remove blanks or assigned them to unknown when I load the node (aka data frame) in my workspace:

########### To remove the blanks from disease_type
BiospecimenData <- BiospecimenData[as.character(BiospecimenData$disease_type)!= "" ,]

########## Rename blanks from disease_type to "Unknown"
BiospecimenData$disease_type[BiospecimenData$disease_type == ""] <- "Unknown"

Tabler()

1. Header names can be less generic.

2. Tutorial on how to save table should be provided.
